# Project Status: Convolens Backend

This document tracks the development progress of the Convolens backend.

## Current State:
- **Steps 1-12** - Completed
- **Step 13: Documentation** - Completed
- **Step 14: Testing (Unit Tests)** - In Progress
    - Added \`pytest\` and \`pytest-flask\` to \`requirements.txt\` and sorted the file.
    - Created \`tests\` directory with \`__init__.py\`.
    - Created \`tests/conftest.py\` with fixtures for:
        - Session-wide Flask app (\`app\`) configured for testing (uses a temporary SQLite DB, temporary upload folder, and memory Celery broker/backend).
        - Flask test client (\`client\`).
        - Database cleaning fixture (\`clean_db\`) to drop and recreate tables for test isolation.
    - Created \`tests/test_api_routes.py\` with initial tests for:
        - \`/health\` endpoint.
        - \`POST /api/upload\` (success, invalid file type, unsupported language).
        - \`GET /api/conversations\` (empty list, listing with data, basic filtering, pagination validation).
        - \`POST /api/analyze/<file_id>\` (mocking Celery task dispatch, DB status update, file not found).
    - Created \`tests/test_services.py\` with initial tests for:
        - \`extract_speaker_statistics\` using a temporary TXT file.
        - \`calculate_persuasion_scores_heuristic\` for basic lexicon matching and empty input.
    - *Note: Test coverage is foundational and not yet exhaustive (e.g., many specific result endpoints, detailed Celery task result flow, and other services are not fully covered).*

## Completed Features:
- All core application features including API, async analysis, DB persistence, Dockerization.
- Basic security and error handling.
- API documentation.
- Foundational unit testing structure and initial tests for key API routes and service functions.

## Missing Features / Next Steps (from original plan):
- *Expand test coverage significantly to meet non-functional requirements (e.g., >80%).*
- *Consider integration tests for the full Celery task pipeline with a test DB.*
- *Final review and refinement of all components.*
